The photos in this chapter are invaluable and beautiful.\\n\\nCons --\\n\\n-- The \"conversational style\" is something a reader may like, or may not. I did not.  I want a clear explanation of a topic, not a conversation with someone who is trying to be casual, witty and amusing for reasons that don\\'t help the explanation along.  The author is apparently trying, in part, to make the book entertaining enough so that the reader wants to learn about the subject; virtually anyone who buys this book, though, already has enough interest in the subject to sustain them through the reading of the book.\\n\\n-- The text on pages 130 and 131 is juxtaposed one with the other.\\n\\n-- The chapter that many readers would want to be the most complete and cutting-edge (that on care of clams in the aquarium, Chapter 5) is the least informational of the book.  The worst section in that chapter is probably the section on lighting.  This section includes absolutely no mention of lighting intensity in any usably objective terms (PAR or even lux), and wastes five paragraphs with a repetitive monologue of his subjective opinions on the \\'looks\\' of various color temperature bulbs.  This chapter also includes a section on feeding, which spends ALL of its ten pages explaining how, how much, what and when to feed, only to conclude with the recommendation \"if you want to avoid all of this, just do what I\\'ve done for years (as have a gazillion other hobbyists) and only keep tridacnids in well-established, well-stocked aquariums with bright lights and don\\'t worry about them.(p. 183)\"  It should also be pointed out that the book devotes most of Chapter 2 to why Tridacnids need not be fed at all!  Lastly, there was no information in the chapter on care of clams that is not currently what passes for common knowledge in the hobby.  While this is fine, in the sense that a book can be usefully a compilation of common practices, I expected more.\\n\\nIn summary: a book that most interested hobbyists will find is worth owning, in spite of the fact that it falls short of a bar that has been set by recent books in the hobby, including Wilkerson\\'s \"Clownfishes\", Borneman\\'s \"Aquarium Corals\" and the three volumes of Delbeek and Sprung\\'s \"The Reef Aquarium\".',\n",

The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on, she got bored.  The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away. It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder, that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version.

When I moved to a place that would allow pets I adopted a 5 year old five toed cat!! She has become the love of my life. I felt guilty leaving her alone, so I ordered the video. She LOVES it!! Being an indoor cat it gives her the feel of being outdoors. When I get ready to leave the apartment she sits in front of the TV and looks at the DVD player and then the TV and meows until I set up the video for her!! She could be sound asleep, but when a certain part of the video comes on, she jumps up and stares at the TV hoping to catch the bluebird!! Highly recommend!',\n",

I read all the reviews, and knew that vol. two was the best, hands down, but for few extra dollars I decided to get all three in a combo pack.  Since birds are a natural source of food for cats (feral) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol. two. Contrary to all the cartoons, cats are not fishermen, and thus, fish, either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to. Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live, they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell. Rodents are also a natural food, so volume one was much better than volume three. Also, the quality could have been better (for my eyes only) but my cats could care less about video quality... they just see birds..  LOL',\n",

A person should ALWAYS consult a professional trainer for information on the proper use of pinch/prong collars. Shock collars should never be used unless they are set on a \"beep\" only setting and under the supervision of a professional.\\n\\nPlease, if you own a dog, watch this show! This DVD set is filled with valuable information about canines and our relationship with them. Cesar gives good information in a no nonsense way that anyone can follow. The first season was wonderful, and you can bet I\\'m going to tune in for season two! Our canines need an advocate like Cesar.\\n\\nI\\'d give this two thumbs up!',\n",

I am also a college biology instructor and I can assure you that Cesar's methods are right on.  Dogs are pack animals, all of them, from pekinese to border collie.  They can never escape their genetic background as pack dominated social animals.  Cesar uses that pack energy to establish order.  The person who talks about pain and intimidation never watched the show.  His methods are far more humane than prong collars and crates.  I have used his techniques with my clients and have had great success.  I thank him daily.  Be the pack leader, watch this DVD\",\n",

He presents it in a very understandable way though on TV.\\n\\nI noted he was very specific on \"putting out the calm, assertive energy\" --which some of Millan\\'s book readers took literally & grew angry that he didn\\'t explain how to grow that \"magic energy\" or whatever... He means carry your face, hands, body & voice in a very calm, quiet, assertive manner, like a top executive, not like a scared, shivering little girl, or an aggressive mean Tasmanian Devil, or a Flapping Bozo the Clown. Note this works on people too.\\n\\nI wholeheartedly agree on exercise working like Dog (& human) Prozac, and it creates a more manageable dog. 4H, again! It also works to control anxiety & concentration in humans & animals.\\n\\nI never thought about dog backpacks and have HUGE hopes for it. I\\'d been trying to think of something that\\'d wear them down a bit. Currently, I have to struggle and fight my way to the 4th lap around the block---by then, they are much calmer & easier to walk. They are easy to walk by themselves, but maybe that pack mentality makes them nutso together. If I leave one at home, he screams, jumps on the window.\\n\\nOn one show, he had the dog pull a skateboarder or roller-skating person. My sister had great results with her boxer pulling her on skates--(use a helmet & guards).\\n\\nNote on his show, there is a frequent disclaimer: \"Do not attempt by yourself, get a professional to help you.\"\\n\\nI totally agree with this--I\\'ve seen people totally misinterpret things on their own in totally goofy, usually lazy & self-serving ways and the pet is the ultimate victim.\\n\\n  Beware of worthless trainers where you walk in, and all the dogs are dragging the owners around like sled-dogs.',\n",

I just got cable TV for the first time in my life ( I'm in my sixties), so I missed all of his TV shows when they were actually on.  Now that I have had cable for a while, I am finding that they appear to only have a select amount of episodes, and they are beginning to repeat.  BUT I GOTTA SEE THEM ALL!!!  So I will buy the seasons on DVD as I can afford them, then I can have a Cesar fix anytime I need one.  What a terrific guy he must be!  I watched the anniversary episode where they brought Lassie to meet him (she is apparently His hero), and I sat here alone in my living room and cried like a little girl, which I no longer am.  I see from buzzing around Amazon that he also has books that tell his story from when he was a young boy with his grandfather.  I hope I get to read them, too.  How many animals set for euthanasia has he saved?!  What  a wonderful guy he must be!  Hail, Cesar!!!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Great DVD! I don\\'t have cable so haven\\'t been able to see the show that I have heard about until I bought the DVDs (I purchased seasons 1 and 2) at the same time. I absolutely love Cesar and just admire his ability! I have a puppy and have to keep watching these DVDs to see what I am doing wrong. Ugh... I only wish a couple of the episodes dealt directly with puppies. All the dogs in these DVDs are grown dogs that have bad habits and he comes in to rehabilitate the dogs and train the owners how to be pack leaders. Although I know it is harder to train a dog with bad habits than it is to train a puppy, puppies are just different and more like juvenile delinquents. Cesar can take any dog with any bad characteristics and within hours (or in the TV world \"within minutes\" is more accurate), you will see a completely different dog. He is just remarkable! Before a couple of episodes I have thought, \"How in the world will Cesar be able to address that problem?\" I have not seen a single problem that he hasn\\'t been able to address.\\n\\nI try to use the same techniques on my puppy, but the key is consistency and frankly after a full day in the office, I often lack the energy to chase after him constantly. I guess it\\'s my own fault if my puppy is a juvenile delinquent because the techniques that Cesar uses actually work. He emphasizes calm assertive energy, which works very well. If I yell at my puppy he either runs and hides under a table or he can get very rambunctious at times and barks at me as if he wants to fight it out - LOL. If I remain calm and assertive and use the techniques that Cesar teaches, my puppy will instantly change his behavior. The problem is that he isn\\'t always at my side and if I see him chewing on something across the room I instantly yell at him to get him to stop the behavior. It works at the moment, but at the end of the day, he won\\'t consider me his pack leader if I continue down that road. That is quite evident when he chooses to bark back at me. Pack leaders of dogs in the wild are always calm and in control.\\n\\nCesar is so educated on the topic of dogs I continue to learn something every time I watch an episode. I even watch them a second time because even though I got it the first time, I often don\\'t follow though exactly as he does. Sometimes the little things make all the difference. Cesar is also very easy on the eyes and has a cute accent to go with it, which make the DVDs even that much more enjoyable if you\\'re a woman. If our a man, you will have to be happy with just the learning portion of it :-)',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This is my first time owning a dog. She is this beautiful pitbull pup I adopted from a shelter. She was 2 1/2 months then. I was afraid of not being able to provide EVERYTHING she needed. My first move was to ask friends who owned dogs, I didn\\'t get much. Next I headed to the internet, I found some information but it was incomplete. At that time, I just wanted to know how to potty train and keep her from crying when she was out in the back yard. She\\'d cry/scream like I was beating her or something. I didn\\'t want the neighbors to think I was harming the dog and call the authorities on me. Friends told me to let her cry, she\\'d eventually get tired. The info I found in the internet said to not give her what she wants when she is showing a bad behavior (in this case, don\\'t let her in when she cries) otherwise I am teaching her to get what she wants through this unwanted behavior. But that\\'s all it said, so I was left hanging on how to get her to stop screaming. I knew not to reward her, but how to stop the behavior?\\n\\nI then began looking for breed specific info, but websites would only tell me what tools I needed to train her (a leash, choke chain, etc.) but then failed to explain why and how to use it. I was so frustrated for the lack of information available. They did say she needed a lot of exercise, so I got a retractable and out I went. In the beginning she was afraid to come out of the house, didn\\'t like the leash, wouldn\\'t want to get in the car, etc.\\n\\nThough I was clueless, I managed to overcome every situation successfully. My source of information were some sheets they gave me at the shelter when I adopter her. Once again, a lot was missing, but it helped anyway.\\n\\nThanks to a few friends, two weeks ago I ordered this DVD. I wish I had watched it sooner. This show is a great source of advice for every dog owner. They show you very specific problems, but often, dogs develop different problems due to the lack of the same \"ingredients\". As he points out, people often treat their dogs like a human being, another family member; and yes, they are a family member, but they are still a dog. You can practice his advice in endless situations and Cesar gives you far more and beyond. The steps are simple, straight forward and in the end, you get to understand your pet inside out. Whether this is your first time owning a dog or if you\\'ve had dogs all of your life; everyone can benefit from this show. Through this DVD set I learned that I was on the right track in how I dealt with the problems I mentioned in the beginning, but my approach could have definitely used some tweaking, as it could have easily gone miserably wrong. The show tells you why they develop those problems and how to rehabilitate your dog. It\\'s mainly a matter of training the human, not the dog. You get to learn that us humans are the source of all their problems and there is pretty much no dog that can\\'t be brought back to a functioning member of society. It makes you realize we are the cause of so many dogs being put down unfairly. Though he doesn\\'t talk about prevention in a direct manner, it doesn\\'t take a genius to notice how you can use everything to prevent unwanted behavior and how to read and understand your dog\\'s language.\\n\\nWhen I started watching the DVD I didn\\'t have any more problems -that I knew of! And this is why I think every dog owner should watch this show. Some people have had dogs all of their lives and may believe that\\'s all it takes to know what they are doing. Even if you have accurate and proven dog psychology knowledge (which most of us don\\'t even come close to that), there\\'s no harm in checking Cesar\\'s techniques out and broaden what you know or what you may think you know. Turns out I have an over excited dog in my hands and I didn\\'t even know it. Thankfully I have identified the problem early on. She is 5 months old now and I have begun addressing the unwanted behavior. It is so comforting to know exactly what to do. The hardest part of it all? People. Believe it or not, she is responding extremely well to it, but people are the problem. I address the excitement and I\\'m not even done with snapping her out of it, when people are already petting her (nurturing the unwanted behavior). To them it\\'s cute, but it won\\'t be cute when you see a fully grown \"happy\" (overexcited) pitbull bouncing/jumping on a child. Also the dog park. When we get to the gate of the fenced area, she starts pulling and getting overexcited, so I start with my ritual and we won\\'t walk in until she calms down. Everyday that passes by, when I face her with the source of her excitement, it takes me less time to snap her out of it. She\\'s learning that she\\'ll get her treat (people and dogs) when she is calmed. She now also comes when I call her and moves along with her pack (me and my husband). Before, she\\'d blast off and wouldn\\'t listen when we called her. Leaving was almost impossible as we had to run after her. Her excitement would take over and we were as good as dead. Everytime I go to the dog park, I have strangers getting mad at me, because they want me to do things their way. People come to me to tell me that her pulling and the excitement are normal; that I should let her get her way and she should be off the leash immediately upon arrival, because \"She should be in control at the dog park\". Completely nonsense, as a pack leader never stops being a pack leader. It\\'s amazing how hard it is to make humans understand dog\\'s psychology. It\\'s so silly that complete strangers get mad at me when I am doing what\\'s right for my puppy. What I am doing at the dog park has had amazing results even at home. Even as I am writing this review my husband got home and for the first time ever, I didn\\'t even say anything and she waited patiently, didn\\'t jump on him and showed good etiquette :)\\n\\nIgnorance among dog owners is staggering and I truly think everyone should watch this show. On my end I just have to thank Cesar. Who knows what my puppy would have become if it wasn\\'t for this amazing source of information. You reading this, don\\'t wait any longer, get this DVD, you and your pet deserve a happy and mentally healthy life.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I have acquired an American Eskimo about 3 years ago and have been searching, buying and trying a lot of books, training courses and dog obedient classes since.  I ran across the TV show recently when I switched TV to satellite.  I only wish I have found out about this earlier.\\n\\nA lot of the reviewers have covered almost every aspects, I just want to include a few points from my views from the shows.\\n\\nThe whole idea of Cesar\\'s method is really simple, be the pack leader and the dog will follow, that will indirectly solve most of the unwanted behavior.  Although the execution is more complicated plus he has a pack of dogs to help him(this is a significant tool that most of us or other dog trainer lack of).\\n\\nI have owned Season 1, 2 & 3 in DVD, plus all the episodes I have taped from Season 4 to 7.  I cannot find any evidence of inhuman behavior or forces as described by some viewers.  Pinning the dog down is the most \"violent\" I have seen but even that, Cesar did not use force or tool, he was only making the dog in a laying down position.  In face, Cesar has been bitten quite a few times!!  And the touches he uses are for correction, if that\\'s really hurting dogs, I am sure the dogs would have attacked Cesar already.\\n\\nAll dogs seems to responded to Cesar all the time and his touches are so effective, almost like miracles.  Let\\'s not forget he is gifted with some ability such as feeling the dog\\'s energy.  He always touch before the dog escalate.  Until we practice this, we\\'ll never have as effective touch as he is, but the shows are definitely fun to watch, just don\\'t expect the same result.\\n\\nThe last point I want to make is about the comment of his technique.  Some viewer regard it as old school.  It is probably true but then it will always works as long as following the leader is still in the DNA.  This is still true today for pack animal such as lions or elephants.  In fact, all those so called new technique does not work well for abused dogs.  I believe Cesar\\'s method covers a much more variety of situation.',\n",

You can tell from the content that the show was working on what would become the winning formula that has garnered Cesar millions of fans - and what has, no doubt, saved millions of dogs. The thing I like most about season 1 over the others is Cesar's expanded explanations about what's going on with these dogs and what the plan is to help them. The vernacular he uses has changed a bit from season 1 to 3, but it's the same, simple message: Exercise, Discipline and Affection in that order and no dog is beyond rehabilitation - regardless of the issue.\\n\\nThe sound issue mentioned by another reviewer? I have fingers. I can turn the volume knob when needed.\\n\\nIf you love Cesar Millan - get season 1. You won't be disappointed! Hail Cesar!\",\n",

Because I was not the Boss, I was the one who showed him how to do tricks (which he did quite well, after pulling my arms out chasing after rabbits).  Exercise!  Discipline!  Affection!  in that order!  and guess what...exercising the dog first works wonders.  And giving him twice daily 2 to 3 mile walks (my husband does one, I do the other) works wonders.  Millan's techniques work in conjunction with this.  The dog now can watch rabbits take off right underneath his nose, and he is so focused on the walk that he basically ignores them.\\n\\nI have to say that I see very few people actually giving their hyperactive dogs 45 minutes of exercise.  I suppose this goes hand in had with the growing health problems we all have.  The best exercise machine, if you are conscientious, is a dog.  Get one, follow Millan's caveats, and voila!

If you watch all the episodes on this DVD, it is hard not to gain a firm understanding of what Cesar is trying to do and incorporate that into your relationship with your dog.  My dog is 100x better these days thanks to Cesar inspiring me to walk my dog everyday and establish consistent boundaries and limitations (rather than just giving him affection all the time).\\n\\nI know that he has been bashed by many trainers and behavioralist, but one this is certain, his methods work!!!  After working with several trainers, one thing they all agree on is that all of them think their way is the best way to train a dog.  Even a clicker trainer was touting how well a clicker works, but as it may be true, who the hell wants to carry a clicker everywhere they go with their dog (or even treats for that matter)?  I think for professional trainers, the more tools you can incorporate in training your pet, including positive reinforcement, compulsion training and flooding, the better you will be in handling a wide range of behavioral problems.\\n\\nBottom line is this.  I know of 2 cases with friends who hired dog trainers who didn\\'t even try to work on their highly aggressive dogs and had them to sleep.  If Cesar could\\'ve given these guys a normal life, then 30 mins of \"flooding\\' is better than sentencing them to death.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I don\\'t have a dog, nor do I think of myself as a dog lover.  Yet, for my money \"The Dog Whisperer\" is one of the finest television programs ever produced.  It is sheer genius on many levels.  To name a few:  The photography and editing, the music, the blend of serious issues and  light-hearted fun, and of course Cesar himself, as unlikely a TV host as you can imagine.\\n\\nI love the way the camera captures the wacky antics of the dogs, accompanied by a whimsical musical score.  I would like to know who selects the music because so often it is brilliant.\\n\\nI think National Geographic took a chance with Cesar.  They could have made a conventional choice and used an experienced, polished host while having Cesar as the show\\'s main character.  Thankfully, they decided to produce an unconventional, trailblazing kind of show.\\n\\nClearly English is Cesar\\'s second language and at best he abandoned his ESL studies early on.  He mangles the language at every turn, and yet he\\'s eloquent and well-spoken when expounding on his life\\'s passion.  Cesar\\'s personality shines through at all times.  He seems like such a likeable, saintly guy.  He sports a Caesar Romero pencil-thin moustache and has a captivating twinkle in his eyes.\\n\\nIt\\'s compelling to watch someone with a gift work his magic, the way you can appreciate Tiger Woods without knowing a thing about golf.  I once saw a horse whispering demonstration by the legendary Monty Roberts, another saintly fellow.  Roberts has made a life\\'s work not only of straightening out troubled horses, he works with troubled youngsters.  Watching their work you are grateful for the positive energy they are bringing into the world.  How about Cesar or Monty for the Nobel Peace Prize?\\n\\nIn this collection, you get to binge on 26 episodes of doggie doings.  The show\\'s participants are well-chosen to demonstrate that dog owners are as amusing as their charges.  You get to peek into the lives of some well-to-do dog owners who enjoy all the benefits of the American dream save one little shortcoming:  neurotic canines.  Then there was the 30-something nerd, still living with his mama, who wanted his dog to learn some manners to facilitate his meeting single women.\\n\\nCesar is a man of mystery.  In one episode we get a quick look at Cesar at home with the kids and his wife, Illusion (were her parents hippies?).  I was startled at Cesar\\'s modest lifestyle.  Why is he living so far below his means?\\n\\nOne of the bonus features is Cesar spending 10 minutes with a Great Dane puppy that is afraid to walk on a shiny linoleum floor.  A collection of out-takes apparently was added to fill up another disk.  Buy, hey, it\\'s Cesar, so I watched them all.  In one, you see how Cesar handles himself on a skate board.  He\\'s a master at that too!',\n",

A practising alpha for over 20 years, Cesar makes everything look so easy, magical and instantaneous. The dogs do not know him, they immediately sense his alpha-ness and thus, they do what he wants. I think the key comes more in initially teaching the owners how to have their dogs see them as the alpha.  A real alpha limits eye contact with his pack, eats first, etc. A dog who sees himself as the alpha and not as the owner is going to need more than a choke chain a finger pointed at it if you ask me. Maybe with some dogs this works, but not my 7. I have since been learning Jan Fennell's method (The Dog Listener) for 3 weeks now and the results clearly discernable. My Jack Russell is actually much calmer!  Jan has a book as well and it's awesome.  I hope she gets her own TV show to give viewers an alternative that will work for them.\",\n",

That you must be your dog\\'s pack leader in order to meet it\\'s needs rather than just meeting your own needs by being \"mommy\" and giving constant affection.\\n\\n3.  That it isn\\'t enough to be a pack leader on the outside, you have to actually *feel* like a pack leader on the inside because dog\\'s are much more in tune to us than we understand, and they will instinctively know it if you are faking it.\\n\\n4.

We have been through clicker training and individual obedience training. They listen to us. They are not food aggressive with us. However, with three dogs the reality is there are pack issues. They do have to be fed in order, they do have to be given attention in order. It is a known fact that especially same sex dogs can have aggressive problems between them because they are establishing top dog status.\\n\\nCesars methods are amazing. What he does is basically show you how to redirect your dogs energy with a slight tug. He has used everything from a gentle leader to a leash used as they do in Eukanuba Tournaments. A slight jerk--not militant style--just a flick of the wrist and you are on the way to redirecting your dogs energy and attentions. A small noise--no yelling, no aggression. Nothing. I have seen how phenominally it worked on my dog who I was told had anxiety problems. As soon as I started using his techniques she began to use me as her beacon--if someone was at the door she looked to me for answers instead of becoming fearful or aggressive. He doesn't use choke collars or spike collars, just a basic leash.\\n\\nThe point is that to say that dogs aren't pack animals is completely off base. Get a group of dogs together and they all run together, unless trained to stay with their owner. And if its neutral territory they play happily. Walk by a fence and look how a dog guards its territory. Clicker training was really great for the basics and creating a well-behaved dog, but Cesar takes you beyond that to a very happy very stable dog. It is just amazing. There is no aggression, it is assertiveness. It is saying I am your leader follow me, when the dog fights a flick of the wrist and a quick noise brings them back. Can you imagine being able to walk three dogs behind with no pulling, tugging or fighting for first place?\\n\\nHow many clicker trainers and other dog trainers have you seen walking a pack of healthy, strong dogs in sets of 10 behind them?\",\n",

So we called a dog trainer that came to the house once a week for 5 weeks.  He is a positive, reward kind of trainer that works well when you want her to do things, but not so well when you want her not to.  We started watching Cesar and are glued to every episode.  It is simple, logical and easy once you understand the psycology of working with a dog from a dog's point of view.

I am one of those who had always thought of my dogs as furry children, and although they are good dogs, I know that they have never looked at me as their pack leader in their 12 and 14 years of life. I also wanted to strongly disagree with some of the reviews that call Cesar's methods cruel and say that he is getting them to obey through fear.  From what I could see on every one of the shows, he never used or reccomended pain as a method of discipline, the dogs listened, but never seemed fearful of him.  In fact they seemed to love him sometimes more than their own owners. He understood them.  I would highly reccomend this DVD to anyone who has or is interested in getting a dog.\",\n",

That is until I undertook my most ambitious project to date.  Tiny, a very alpha pitbull puppy that had been removed from his litter at four weeks old.  I saw him and knew that if he ended up with anyone else, it wouldn\\'t be long before his high energy overtook his family.  What I hadn\\'t counted on was his energy overtaking mine.  With Tiny I had met my match.  I have no formal education as a dog handler.  Just a natural instinct that has always got me through.  I needed some help.  Cesar\\'s techniques and explainations were very clear and easy for anyone who was willing to do the work.  Moreover, they gave me an insight to the reasons that I had always had \"good luck\" with dogs.  I was able to change the things that I was doing wrong and intensify the the things I was doing well.  Today Tiny is a happy go lucky 10 month old with a great disposition.  Though he still tests my patience every now and again, I\\'m confident that as he grows out of his puppy energy into an adult energy, that he will be the best dog I\\'ve ever owned.\\n\\nThe downside to this collection is that after about the first four or five shows, it is predictable.  The message is never changing.  The results are for the most part the same.  Cesar saves the day, teaches the owner how to properly walk his/her dog.  Tells them to be the leader of the pack.  The end.  In short the collection is a bit long.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Bought this for my wife\\'s b-day. The coolest thing (to us, personally)is that the very first segment is about Cesar dealing with a Chihuahua, of which we have 4! If you are a dog lover than this is just so much fun to watch. Although it is stated that this is not a \"how to train your dogs\" video, you can actually learn alot from this series. If you are open minded you can see how alot of what he says about the pet owners on his show can apply to you. Further more, this video is good to watch even if you do not own your own dog. Cesar explains alot about general people behavior which can apply if you visit people who have dogs. Your behaviour around dogs can have as much impact on them as their owner\\'s.\\n\\nThere is the risk that some people might find the show too repetetive. In many of the cases that Cesar deals with, the advice and the lessons are very much the same. He constatnly talks about the notion of the pack leader, confident energy, consistancy and the dominant/submisive role between dog and owner. In almost every segment, Cesar begings by taking a walk with the dog in order to gain it\\'s trust and establish his dominance over the animal. On the other hand this repetetiveness can speak towards Cesar\\'s confidence in his techniques and HIS consistancy in using this knowlodge to deal with a many different issues. And there are just enough unique cases to keep the series fresh.\\n\\nThe other thing that people need to know about before watching this program is that Cesar regularly uses physical restraint, both with his hands and with leashes placed right at the base of the dogs\\' head in order to correct the animals. Although he re-asures that he is not causing physical pain to the dogs, these techniques may seem a bit on the disturbing side to those of us who love to baby our pets or are overly sensitive. I would urge anyone who may have issues with this sort of treatment to listen to how Cesar refers to his assertive, physical behaviour as an imitation of the dogs\\' own natural way of communicating and establishing dominance amongst themselves.\\n\\nOverall, the program is a real treat. Especially when you consider that the ultimate goal for Cesar is to create more natural and balanced relationships between people and their dogs. There are many touching moments, such as the case where he rehabilitates a dog who was schedualed to be put to sleep because it was considered too agressive. The family was devestated because thier oldest son was extrememly attatched to the dog and vise versa. By the time Cesar was through with the dog, it was impossible to imagine that uthenasia was ever an option for the animal. The child was so greatful because he no longer had to worry about loosing his best friend.\\n\\nI also bought the book, \"Cesar\\'s Way\" along with this video. However, we have been having too much fun watching the DVD\\'s that we have yet to read the book to give it a review.\\n\\nDid I mention the awesome price on AMAZON? The book, the DVD and two day shipping cost me less then the DVD alone had I bought it at a retail store! As such I was able to get it shipped right on time for my wife\\'s birthday. Thanks again AMAZON for the great service!',\n",

One thing I learned is that loving a dog as if the dog were a human is first a diservice to the dog and second an act of selfish neediness on the dog owner's part. Dogs have dog needs, Cesar Millan shows, and by giving the dog boundaries and discipline, rather than indulging the dog like a spoiled princess, the dog owner actually makes the dog more happy.\\n\\nI give Cesar Millan credit for raising our consciousness about dogs, and pets in general, and in this sense Millan is a great humanitarian.\",\n",

(2) Although initially the change in the dogs is almost mesmerizing, the core of the show is how this changes people's lives.\\n\\nWe applied the approach with our 5-month old Border Collie puppy that's a bundle of energy and was exhausting us to manage her at home. We've been fans of the show but were not having much success with the dog. My wife was away for three days during which I watched a few shows again to see what I was missing. I had to adjust a few things, but also change my own mental approach. When she came back my wife was amazed to see the changes in real life. Our dog is attentive, happy, but much more relaxed. She's almost teaching herself how to do what I want, now that she's not over-excited when I work with her.\\n\\nI'm much more relaxed too, no longer getting frustrated, and my arm's not tired from restraining the dog all the time. I was surprised, too, by how much less effort his approach takes. I wish I'd known about this when we had our previous BC.\\n\\nBeing able to re-watch the shows lets me concentrate on what the people needed to change in themselves, then review the practical aspects. It's often the people's issues that are most enlightening, since the techniques are simple and consistent.\\n\\nThis is a treasure for anyone who loves dogs. The only thing better than this set wiil be the season 2 set, as the show keeps getting even better.\",\n",

He has an amazing touch with animals. If anything, anyone thinking about getting a dog should watch this before they make up their minds. Dogs are such complex animals (and capable of so much, good and bad!) that prospective owners must consider their responsiblities - to the dog, themselves, their families, and society at large. The shows are well done (although watching a whole bunch of them in a row can get a little repetitive), Cesar is clear with his explanations and delivers his message in a charming, positive way and is easy to understand. If anything, I wish they had been longer in length so that more detailed exploration for each of the problems could have been made. Nevertheless, a great series!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Almost two years ago, my daughter went to a rescue organization to adopt a dog.  She found a sweet, but shy, 15 lb. female mixed breed who had been owner surrendered for various reasons.  Her background information suggested that she\\'d been living in the backyard of a non-english speaking family, and had never been socialized.  Of course, my daughter thought she could bring this dog out of her shell by giving her a good home and taking her along when visiting friends.  The dog quickly became a nightmare with a fear-based aggression that my daughter and I were at wits-end to control.  On walks, she would go berserk if someone jogged by, another dog was around, or (heaven forbid) a garbage truck was on the street.  She even took a chunk of fur out of our good friend\\'s sweet-natured shih tzu when we tried to introduce them.  She also \"protected\" her food and toys, and paced around my parrot\\'s birdcage like a preditor.  My daughter consulted several \"trainers\" in the area, all of whom told her that fear-based aggression is nearly impossible to overcome and would take a great deal of time, possibly one to two years, to see improvement, if at all.  She was basically discouraged from keeping this dog, so she brought it back to the rescue organization two weeks after having brought her home.  She was truly devistated.\\n\\nSince that time, we both adopted dogs from rescue.  Her dog, an 11 lb. female chihuahua mix, and mine, a 15 lb. female terrier mix, had none of the issues that were exhibited by the first failed rescue dog.  There were issues, however.  The chihuahua would guard the door and bark like crazy if people walked by.  The terrier was a pain to walk at the nearby park where there are more ground squirrels than she could possibly count.  She would pull so hard on her leash that I finally stopped taking her there during our walks.\\n\\nThen, I discovered Cesar Millan during a guest appearance on Martha Stewart\\'s talkshow.  I was so intrigued by his dialogue on dog behavior that I watched his television show.  My daughter and I have applied his techniques on both of our dogs to great success.  The chihuahua no longer \\'owns\\' the door at her house, and I am now the \"calm-assertive leader\" on our walks.  We now walk the park without any pulling -- even when the squirrels run across our path!\\n\\nWe have since watched all of the Dog Whisperer episodes.  Cesar\\'s common sense approach to dog behavior has really opened our eyes.  Unfortunately, common sense isn\\'t so common.  You cannot apply human behavior to a dog, it just doesn\\'t compute.  They are pack animals with an observable social structure.  While most people are aware of this fact, we just don\\'t grasp the significance with our own pet dogs.  It is my hope that dog owners everywhere can learn to practice calm-assertive leadership with their \"pack\".  I only wish that we\\'d had this information BEFORE adopting the first rescue dog.  We really feel that we could have made a positive difference in this animal had we known the \"exercise, discipline, affection\" rule.  Our approach of \"affection, affection, exercise, only served to make her worse.\\n\\nThank you Cesar, for teaching us how to better relate to our dogs.  They are such a joy!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have two dogs that I got from animal shelters.  One had been badly abused by and rescued from the previous owners.  I fell in love with her at first sight and was determined to give her a good home.  I took both dogs to basic training classes, thinking that classes would help them get socialized to other dogs and people, but basic training classes don't teach much on dog psychology, and that's what I learned I really needed to know. I've come to think that understanding dog psychology is much more important than taking a dog to training classes and ought to come first.  (Training classes would go so much better if all dog owners knew about and applied dog psychology first.)  This DVD helped give me the knowledge I needed about dog psychology to help rehabilitate my dogs from being anxious to being relaxed.  There's a lot of controversy over Millan's methods, but if you apply the psychology -- ignore or prevent the unwanted behavior and pet and reward the dog when it's calm -- you should have good results.  Unfortunately, the show focuses almost exclusively on the problem behavior and stopping/preventing it rather than showing a lot of rewarding, so viewers don't see much of the positive signs of love that Millan or the owners give their dogs.  The good thing about the DVD is that you can see the body language of Millan and the dogs. I've found that very helpful.  Even if you don't agree with all of Millan's methods, the DVD can still be helpful for learning about dog psychology.  Millan's DVD along with _The Dog Listener_ by Jan Fennell have been the most useful sources for me so far for learning how to shape my own behavior in order to have happy, calm dogs.  I highly recommend both of these sources on dog psychology.\",\n",

Any trainer can make a dog sit, stay, heel, but few can deal with difficult dogs and, more importantly, their owners as Cesar does.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard many trainers denounce Cesar Millan but few who have any demonstrated success of their own in rehabilitating truly difficult dogs and training their owners.  If some owners, as someone claimed in a previous review, take this advice too liberally, that\\'s not Cesar\\'s fault or intended message.  His shows and books are meant to help dog owners to better understand their relationship with their dogs, but as he says often on his show, the problems are most often with the owners themselves.\\n\\nTo the trainer below from San Diego, I\\'d love to know what your theory and methods are because your post completely discredits you.  As a dog owner myself and one who finds that Cesar\\'s ideas really work, I\\'d never seek your training services.  Anyone can be a dog lover, and so many of us well intended owners are, but very few actually know how to truly fulfill a dog.  From what I\\'ve seen here in Los Angeles, where the population of unwanted dogs and the numbers of dogs with behavioral problems is out of control, I wish more people would watch this show.\\n\\nCesar doesn\\'t use any techniques that I haven\\'t seen, in my own personal experience, other reputable trainers use, but he does it better with calm assertive energy.  Even non-dog owners may be fascinated as to how these theories can apply to their own lives.  Watch the National Geographic show or this DVD, and see for yourself.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Let me start out by saying that I read many books on dog training before and after bringing home our English Cocker Spaniel puppy and put the training techniques to work immediately. We took our pup to socialization and obedience training classes.  Despite all that effort and training, our happy 11 month old puppy developed \"issues\" of hyperactivity, jumping on people and dogs, being possessive of her toys, whining, destructive chewing, and pulling on her leash. All the positive training methods recommended for resolving those issues were not effective.  Just when I was at wits end, another dog owner introduced me to The Dog Whisperer.  That now feels like divine intervention.  Recently I purchased the DVD set of the first year episodes of the National Geographic channel\\'s Dog Whisperer and Cesar Millan\\'s book together.  I watched, read, assimilated, and applied the rehabilitation advice and methods contained in Cesar\\'s DVD set and book. I must report that Cesar\\'s advice and methods have worked like magic to resolve our puppy\\'s \"issues.\"  In one short week, I have applied calm assertive leadership for our pup, and she has absolutely thrived on twice daily \"primal\" walks, consistent discipline (rules, boundaries, and limitations), and affection - in that order. As a result, our puppy is in a calm receptive state of mind 99% of the time.  Her \"issues\" have all but disappeared.  Amazing.  Simply amazing.  Spread the word: Cesar Millan\\'s dog psychology and rehabilitation methods are right on.',\n",

My sister and I took our pups to puppy class for gentle persuasion training.\\nOur pups always seem to be looking for the treat, even though we followed the instructions to ween them off.  The trainer told me to crate the puppies and separate them in order for them to stop fighting for dominance. This did not work. They also told us to use a treat in the hand to keep the pups by our side when walking. These gentle methods probably work for pups that aren't so active.  I heard about CM and I bought the DVD. I had never seen the show but people at work said this stuff works.  My pup is 5mo. old and in 2 days I got him to stop fighting for dominance and both pups walk by my side without fighting or pulling.  My pups ears were standing straight up since puppy classes, he has always been very on gaurd and always looking around.  Ceaser was right, now that my pup knows I am the leader he is much more relaxed. I was shocked to notice that he relaxes his ears now unless he hears a very loud noise.  These techniques are excellent for lively dogs. Its important to learn the psychology of a dogs reactions.  Ceaser makes it very clear that these techniques are not done with force to hurt dogs, they are techniques to get the attention of an out of control dog.  I have never, nor would I ever use something that would be cruel to my pup. I am offended that Ms. Dog Lover has inferred that the hispanic community thinks Mr. Millan is a god because he is Latino.  Maybe they just respect what works and are not looking for pretentious backgrounds from people with dog advice. It's possible there is some other factor that her clients have in common. Even better, perhaps she should look at her clients on a case by case policy rather than sterotype. If you want something that works, this is it, and it doesnt cost anywhere from $100 to $300 like puppy classes. I will add to my review when my pup is over a year to see if he reverts the way some of the unfavorable reviews are claiming he will....\",\n",

We have  spent quite a lot on dog food, dry,wet, fresh, all guaranteed to provide all the health benefits she needs. After one or two times she would stop eating, dog food is expensive to have to by again a new brand. After two days of cooking fresh foods for her I knew I was on the right track. She loves her food, & enjoys it so much, it makes us happy to see her not turn away from her food, and that she is eating healthy. Other books did not go into so much detail about what dogs can eat, and I was grateful to learn about the supplements like calcium. Feeding my dog fresh ingredients has been wonderful, after all its most of the same things people eat, this book goes into great detail, I thank the authors very much.\",\n",

With the high temperatures this summer, we don\\'t want to heat up the house any more than it already is! With this book, we never feel like we\\'re missing our kitchen when we cook outdoors. We have a simple fire pit in the backyard, and we absolutely love the fresh, new ideas this book supplies. Of the 20+ recipies in the book, I had only heard of two. Additionally, there are about an equal number of savory to sweet recipies.\\n\\nEASE-OF-USE\\nI was pleased to find a very simple, uniform layout to the book - kid-friendly but not kid-like - and you won\\'t find many exact measurements, either (cooking outdoors is too laid back to be bogged down with measuring cups!). Its full-color pages with lots of pictures and a few simple captions are the recipes\\' instructions. Most of the ingredients are household items (pickles, bacon, bread/biscuit/crescent dough, cheese, etc.) or inexpensive at the store.\\n\\nCOOLNESS FACTOR\\nWe love having friends over even more now because they\\'re always wowed by the yummy ideas from this book! Kiddos love to get involed, too. What a better way to save money on energy, save the sweating in the hot kitchen, and gain a \"cool\" activity on a summer night!\\n\\nJust ordered it for my brother as a thank-you gift as well, and with his two kids under 10 and late daylight hours in northern USA, they\\'ll never run out of summer backyard cookin\\' fun!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'My family lives in the mountains and there is a huge camping culture here, so we try to find easy, but also tasty ideas for cooking \"in the wild\". The standard camping fare can get pretty old, so it\\'s really nice to add in some new simple recipes that also taste good, too!  In this book, many of the savory and sweet dishes are cooked in pie irons or in aluminum foil. They also use easy to find items like refrigerated biscuit dough and mini shortcakes that are convenient to take with you on your trip.  My favorite recipe was the Toasted Coconut Pumpkin Pies which only use three ingredients: pumpkin pie filling, bread and toasted coconut marshmallows! I also liked the baked apples, that are made simply by cooking the apple in the campfire until done, then removing the skin and rolling it in cinnamon and sugar.  I thought Campfire Treats had very creative ideas and recipes, with a fun layout and tons of photos!',\n",

My preference (and therefore bias you should know about) is for the Wusthofs.\\nThe Wusthof Grand Prix line is a more modern design than the Classic series, with a simple black handle.  The balance and grip of these knives are as close to perfect as I have found.  For those wondering what benefits a higher priced knife provides, one benefit is that the blade (or tang) is one piece all the way through the handle.  This makes the blade much stronger, and less likely to snap.\\nThis particular model is the 3  inch paring knife.  This knife falls into the category of overkill for me.  Most cooks will get by just fine with the 4  inch utility knife.  There is really no notable difference in size for the vast majority of applications between the 3  inch paring knife and the 4  inch utility knife.\\nDon't get me wrong; this is a very good knife.  However, for the mainstream chef, I think its usage will be minimal, and thus it is overkill.  Look for the 4  inch utility knife first.  If you own that knife, and you need this size for a specific application, this knife is great.\",\n",

The only thing I would say is that they are so well built and thick that the resistance of the band is so strong that it limits the type of exercises you can do with them (especially the widest one).  This is why I gave this a 4 and not a 5, but the bands are great quality--just wish there was more of a variety in the resistance.  There is no way I could keep it under my foot and do a shoulder exercise for example.

       "  'reviewText': 'Finally some relief for my pup! I was surprised at how quickly my dog has responded to this wonderful product. My 10 year old Tibetan terrier started to have hip and back problems and was having difficulty getting up and issues jumping on and off the couch. My veterinarian recommended I try to find a supplement with Glucosamine. I started giving Rupee chews with Glucosamine but he almost always spit it out. With the liquid supplement I just pour over a combination of wet and dry food and he eats it right up. I was amazed that within ONE WEEK after taking Fortified Pets Hip and Joint Rupee is having an easier time getting up and able to jump on the couch again. I have seen a huge improvement in his mobility. Im so thankful I found something that works for my Rupee!',\n",

I was able to actually blend it to the point that it was in my skin and build it up with them, which I could not do with my beauty blender, So I have to say for concealer I am hooked. For contour though it takes a bit to learn to use since they are super soft and soak up product easily if you do not wet them a bit before using them. So far so good!

I will often bring my deck on long drives and holiday weekends for entertainment and authentic connection. I recently had a Think Deck conversation that lasted hours and uncovered all sorts of surprising similarities and nuances with someone I would consider to be my best friend. I also joke that Think Deck is my litmus test for dating-- meaning, if I suspect my date to be interested in the sort of vulnerability and self reflection realized in a game of Think Deck, I will give it another go :)',\n",

A little under a year ago we got him the Mr. Moose (that's what we call it) from the above collection. He loved it so much he took it to his crate at night. I even bought him a second one a few months later in case the first Mr. Moose met with foul play.\\n\\nWell, when I saw this collection of three Kong toys (including yet a third Mr. Moose) I went for it. We intended to give him one toy at a time, but he got into the doggy box and pulled out all three and he was in doggy heaven.\\n\\nI don't know whether it's the size, the shapes, the smells, or what it is about these Kong toys, but they are just so terrific. He wrestles with them and chews on them and  we play catch with them as well,  and they really take a beating and keep on ticking. He loves them all (though Mr. Moose is probably still the favorite with the alligator a close second.)\\n\\nI cannot recommend them enough. Our Vinnie is a small dog but he chews and abuses these toys all day and like I said, he's had the Kong Moose for well over 8 months and hasn't torn through it yet. Perhaps for a bigger dog that might be a problem, but these Kong toys are so sturdy they're the only ones I really feel comfortable leaving him with in his crate at night.\\n\\nHighly recommended. OBVIOUSLY.\",\n",

I place this on top of my table saw or work table when I need it and put it away when not in use.  The sliding self adjusting clamping system that is located on two adjacent sides of the table work very well.  Four alignment blocks that also work in this track system really helps align your work pieces when assembling your project.\\nThis clamp table system was easy to assemble, but is very heavy to move around, so if you have room for the leg system, you may want to go with that option.
